# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

- [Read the documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/)

# Vite

Vite is an opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during development, and bundles it with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for production.

- [See the repository](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
